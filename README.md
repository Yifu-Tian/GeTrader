# 🧬 GeTrader (Gemini-Powered Trader for Cryptocurrency)

**GeTrader** is an advanced, self-evolving cryptocurrency quantitative trading terminal powered by Google's Gemini AI.


GeTrader acts as a sentient trader. It combines Technical Analysis (TA), News Sentiment Analysis, and a Self-Reflection Mechanism to simulate a human-like learning process. It remembers past mistakes, adapts its strategy based on market volatility, and evolves over time.


## Key Features

**🧠Evolutionary Memory Core:** 

The AI maintains a "Lesson Book." If a trade results in a significant loss, the AI reflects on the error (e.g., "ignored RSI divergence") and stores it in memory to prevent repeating the mistake in future decisions.

**📰Multi-Dimensional Data Analysis**:

   - **Technical Analysis:** Locally computes EMA (Trend), RSI (Momentum), Bollinger Bands (Volatility), and ATR (Risk).
  
   - **Fundamental Analysis:** Real-time scraping of Google News RSS to analyze market news sentiment (Bullish/Bearish).

**📝Paper Trading Engine:** A built-in simulation engine that tracks:
   * Real-time Floating PnL (Profit and Loss)
   * Win/Loss Ratio
   * Strategy Confidence Score
